# Dafter
A Jupyter notebook to discover successful deck archetypes using data from 17lands.com.

## Getting Started
There are a few things you need first before you can run the notebook yourself.
- I recommend creating a virtual environment in your project directory as a best practice. I used virtualenv.
- Install the required dependencies: Seaborn and Scikit-learn (you get NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib among others by doing this).
- Download and unzip the latest draft data from 17lands.com into the root of your project directory.
